Downloader of cell phone/mobile towers/cells (and, hopefully, in future, of signal coverage).

## CLARIFICATION on LICENSING

General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the

This program does not carry or distribute any cell tower data with it. The default data source for
this program is [RemoCell/CellsData](https://github.com/RemoCell/CellsData), which is licensed under
the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International

But the choice to use that data source is up to you: This program will not access that default data
source without your affirmative action. It could be also used with other data sources if compatible:
The convention for storage file paths and their format is open and documented.

If you do choose to use it with that data (one from
[RemoCell/CellsData](https://github.com/RemoCell/CellsData)), know that it is derived from
[OpenCelliD data](https://opencellid.org/downloads.php) and from

### SOFTWARE IS ALLOWED ON MOBILE APP STORES

This software is and will always be under GNU GPL license, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

However, the goal is also to make it available for non-technical people who use [Google Play (app
store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps), [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) or
similar distributors. That is, hopefully, ensured by the following declaration.

The following declaration is not a legal statement and it cannot be legally enforced. It is only an
expression of good will.

The initial author (Peter Lyons Kehl) declares that

- Any future updates to this software will continue be free, and under GNU GPL license, either
  version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version; and at the same time the software
  will be allowed to be distributed for free on mobile app stores as per exception described below.
- This software is allowed to be published by Google Play, Apple App Store and other distributors,
  as far as:
  - The software build/binary/package is based purely on source code from this project (as it is in
    its GitHub repository's `main` branch); and
  - There are no modifications to the software; and
  - Neither the store/distributor, nor the person or organization who submitted/uploaded/published
    it or who manages it, charge the end user; and
  - They clearly state unmodified references to the license and source code.
- The initial author will NOT enforce (or delegate enforcing) GNU GPL license in such cases, unless
  they act in ways he deems unfair/restrictive.
  - As per [gnu.org: Violations of the GNU
    Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html): "In most countries only the
    copyright holders are legally empowered to act against violations."
- The initial author will (obviously) NOT charge the users for downloading or using the software.
- The initial author will NOT pass his copyright to any other person or organization, unless they
  promise to keep this intent.
- Unfortunately, [Apple Store "Minimum"
  Terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/minterms/) require the end-user
  license to be non-transferrable. However, that applies to distribution through Apple Store only.
  
  The initial author, and any maintainers, promise to also publish the same (or similar)
  binary/packaged application on GitHub releases, which would be under GNU GPL, either version 3 of
  the License, or (at their option) any later version.
  
  In case of any doubt, the source code and any releases published on GitHub are under GNU GPL,
  either version 3 or (at the option of the initial author or maintainers) newer, and you can use
  them under that license version or (at your option) any later GNU GPL license version.

- To achieve that, this software does not, and will not, depend on or include any other software (or
  parts of) that would be published/contributed under GNU GPL license only.
  - Any parts not contributed by the initial author:
    - Any dependencies, or
    - Any re-used or incorporated (parts of) other software, or
    - Any accepted contributions (through GitHub Pull Requests, GitHub Issues or in other ways),

    will be accepted/used/incorporated only if they allow this overall intent: for example:
    - in public domain, or
    - under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit), or
    - under [Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), or
    - under other "permissive" licenses compatible with this overall intent.
  - Contributors (other than the initial author) must license their contribution under one of the
    above mentioned "permissive" licenses. And they must clearly indicate the fact:
    - If their contribution is through a GitHub Pull Request, they must clearly identify the whole
      contribution (under a given Pull Request) as being under a permissive license by mentioning
      the license in a comment of such a GitHub Pull Request. This may be facilitated by GitHub Pull
      Request template(s), which the contributor must acknowledge by checking an initially unchecked
      checkbox, or by some other clear expression.
    - If their contribution is in some other way, they have to clearly express (in writing) what
      license their contribution is under.
  - This declaration is not an endorsement or support of any extra restrictions applied/enforced by
    any such distributors.
  - The initial author may, time permitting, enforce (or delegate enforcing) GNU GPL on
    - any unfair/restrictive distributors, even if they don't charge the users (other than existing
      restrictions of mobile app stores as-is of 2024; and ), or
    - on any other violations.
