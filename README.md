This program does not carry or distribute any cell tower data with it. The default data source for

But the choice to use that data source is up to you: This program will not access that default data
source without your action. It could be also used with other data sources if compatible: The
convention for storage file paths and their format is open and documented.

If you choose to use it with that data (one from
[RemoCell/CellsData](https://github.com/RemoCell/CellsData)), know that it is derived from
[OpenCelliD data](https://opencellid.org/downloads.php) and from

### SOFTWARE IS ALLOWED ON MOBILE APP STORES

This software is and will always be under GNU GPL license, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

However, the goal is also to make it available for non-technical people who use [Google Play (app
store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps), [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) or
similar distributors. That is, hopefully, ensure by the following declaration.

The following declaration is not a legal statement and it cannot be legally enforced. It is only an
expression of good will.

The initial author (Peter Lyons Kehl) declares that

- This software is and will continue to be free, and under GNU GPL license for as long as possible,
  if that allows distribution described below.
  - Source code of this software, as whole, will NOT be ever released under any license other than
    GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version, as far as that license allows the intent of this
    declaration.
- Yet, at the same time, this software is allowed to be published by Google Play, Apple App Store
  and other distributors, as far as
  - They don't charge the end user, and
  - They don't modify a reference to the license and source code.
- The initial author will NOT enforce GNU GPL license on such distributors.
- The initial author will (obviously) NOT charge the users for downloading or using the software.
- The initial author will NOT pass his copyright to any other person or organization, unless they
  promise to keep this intent.
- Unfortunately, [Apple Store "Minimum"
  Terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/minterms/) require the end-user
  license to be non-transferrable. However, that applies to distribution through Apple Store only.
  The initial author, or maintainers, promise to also publish the same (or similar) binary/packaged
  application on GitHub releases, which would be under GNU GPL.
- To achieve that, this software does not, and will not, depend on or include any other software (or
  parts of) issued only under GNU GPL license.
  - Any parts not contributed by the initial author:
    - Any dependencies, or
    - Any re-used or incorporated (parts of) other software, or
    - Any accepted contributions (through GitHub Pull Requests, GitHub Issues or in other ways),

    will be accepted/used only if they allow this overall intent. For example, if they are
    - in public domain, or
    - under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit), or
    - under [Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), or
    - under other "permissive" licenses compatible with this overall intent.
  - Other contributors must license their contribution under one of the above mentioned "permissive"
    licenses:
    - If their contribution is through a GitHub Pull Request, they must clearly identify the whole
      contribution (under a given Pull Request) as being under a permissive license by mentioning
      the license in a comment of such a GitHub Pull Request. This may be facilitated by GitHub Pull
      Request template(s), which the contributor must acknowledge by checking an initially unchecked
      checkbox, or by some other clear expression.
    - If their contribution is in some other way, they have to clearly express (in writing) what
      license their contribution is under.
  - This intent is not an endorsement or support of any extra restrictions applied/enforced by any
    such distributors.
  - The initial author will, time permitting, enforce GNU GPL on any unfair distributors (even if
    they don't charge the users) or on any other violations.
